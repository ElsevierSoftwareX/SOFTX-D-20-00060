EQP Equivalent Polynomials Library - A 2D/3D library for integration of polynomials times step function

Currently, EQP Library  includes functions for the evaluation of Equivalent Polynomials for the following linear 2D and 3D finite elements:
linear triangle;
linear quadrilateral;
linear tetrahedron;
linear hexahedron.

The EQP Library archive download contains:
a pdf application note illustrating the Library and its usage;
the FORTRAN90 source code of the Library;
a FORTRAN90 usage example file
the BibTeX file of the References to be cited to support the deelopment work of this Library

If you find this Library useful, please always cite the following two papers in all your works making their use:
